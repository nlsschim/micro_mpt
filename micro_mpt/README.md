# micro_mpt

micro_mpt is a Python package that provides a framework for calculating microrheological properties from nanoparticle tracking data in soft matter systems. It is designed to be modular, allowing new users to easily add features to the codebase.

## Installation

To install micro_mpt, navigate to the root directory of the project and run the following command:

```bash
python setup.py install
```

## Usage

```python
import micro_mpt
```

You can then use the functions and classes provided by the package to calculate microrheological properties.

## TODO

- Implement the main functions and classes in `module1.py` and `module2.py`.
- Write unit tests for the functions and classes in `test_module1.py` and `test_module2.py`.
- Fill in the project metadata in `setup.py`.
